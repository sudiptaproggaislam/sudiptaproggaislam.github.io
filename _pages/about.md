I'm a researcher with broad interests in **Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Natural Language Processing, and Large Language Models**. I’ve developed advanced frameworks for medical image segmentation and classification, and worked with state-of-the-art models to push the boundaries of AI applications. I've completed my bachelor’s in Computer Science & Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology, Rajshahi, Bangladesh. 

I’m always eager to take on fresh challenges and collaborate on groundbreaking projects—feel free to reach out!
