## Projects


### **Optimizing Feature Representation of Deep Neural Networks for Enhanced Deepfake Detection** [[Project]](https://github.com/ashraf-ul-alam-amit/Deepfake-Image-Detection)  
*VGG16, Channel Attention, ResNet50, Deepfake*  
- Focused on detecting deepfake images using the [140k Real and Fake Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces/data) dataset. Employed VGG16 as the primary feature extractor, then introduced a **channel attention mechanism** to prioritize relevant feature vectors and finally achieved a high classification accuracy of 99.80%. Further, conducted an **ablation study** with ResNet50.

### **Fake News Detection System** [[Project]](https://github.com/sudiptaproggaislma)  
*NLP, Tensorflow, Keras, GloVe Embeddings, LSTM*  
- Built a system to classify news as fake or real using GloVe embeddings and an LSTM-based neural network in TensorFlow. Performed data preprocessing and analysis, and evaluated the model with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

### **Cardiotocogram Data Analysis for Fetal Health Classification Using Machine Learning** [[Project]](https://github.com/ashraf-ul-alam-amit/fetal_health) [[Slide]](https://github.com/ashraf-ul-alam-amit/fetal_health/blob/master/fetal_health.pdf)  
*Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, SMOTE*  
- Aimed to classify fetal health status from Cardiotocogram (CTG) data using machine learning models. Utilized a dataset of 2,126 records with 21 features. Applied models like Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting, achieving the highest accuracy of **98.47%**. Employed feature selection, data standardization, and SMOTE to enhance performance.

### **Maternal and Child Health Care**  [[Project]](https://github.com/ashraf-ul-alam-amit/Maternal_Care)
*HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Android Studio, Java, XML, Firebase Database*  
- Developed a responsive website for Maternal and Child Health Care featuring due date calculations, immunization schedules, personalized notifications, and a query posting feature. Created a mobile app using Android Studio and Firebase with the same features.
