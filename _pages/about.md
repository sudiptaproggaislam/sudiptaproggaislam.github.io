I am currently working as a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at BGMEA University of Fashion & Technology (BUFT), Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my bachelor’s in Computer Science & Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), Rajshahi, Bangladesh. As a researcher, I have broad interests in *Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Large Language Models, and Vision Language Models*. I’ve developed advanced frameworks for medical image segmentation and classification, and worked with state-of-the-art models to push the boundaries of AI applications.

I’m always eager to take on fresh challenges and collaborate on groundbreaking projects—feel free to reach out!
