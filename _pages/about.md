I’m Sudipta, a researcher passionate about solving real-world problems through AI. With an undergraduate degree in *Computer Science and Engineering* from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology *(RUET)*, my research work spans **Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation**. I've developed advanced frameworks for medical image segmentation and classification and worked with state-of-the-art models to enhance AI applications.

My diverse projects range from optimizing neural networks for healthcare to addressing OCR challenges with complex scripts like Bengali. Notable projects include *Real-time Cycle Thief Detection* using YOLOv5 and DeepSORT and advanced medical image segmentation with *knowledge distillation*. Currently, I’m exploring **Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models**, finding them both fascinating and full of potential. 

Always on the lookout for innovative opportunities to explore and collaborate. Let’s connect and build something innovative together!
